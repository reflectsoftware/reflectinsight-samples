# Hello ReflectInsight Sample

This sample will show you how to start working with ReflectInsight with no configuration and the results will show up in the ReflectInsight Live Viewer.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install ReflectInsight, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package ReflectSoftware.Insight
```

### Usage

Add a using reference to the ReflectSoftware.Insight namespace.

```csharp
using ReflectSoftware.Insight;
```

Then for this sample we're going to use the default log manager for sending our log message.

```csharp
RILogManager.Default.SendMessage("Hello, ReflectInsight!");
```

That's it your done! Build your app and check it out.
